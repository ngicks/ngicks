## Hi there 👋

### Name

The name ngicks is made from 2 words.

- 苦い(bitterness)
- シゲキックス(Series of candy made and sold by 味覚糖株式会社)

One of my favorite video game, Pikmin 2, had ゲキニガスプレー(gekiniga-spray, ultra-bitter spray) and ゲキカラスプレー(gekikara-spray, ultra-spicy spray).

シゲキックス is famous for its super-sour taste.

I had a terribly simple idea to combine these 2 words to form up a name.

### Commit emoji prefix

I prefer emoji commit prefixes, e.g.

```
✨(module name if monorepo): breif description of change
```

The list of prefix emoji-es is as follows.

| prefix | meaning                                             |
| :----- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| ✨     | new or change of features                           |
| 🐛     | bug fixes                                           |
| 🚀     | performance optimization                            |
| 🧹     | cleaning / refactor                                 |
| 🔥     | removing stuff                                      |
| 📦     | moving files / bump dep versinons                   |
| ✅     | add / change tests                                  |
| 📝     | add / change documents                              |
| 👷     | change of build / build constraint / CI/CD workflow |

This list is likely expanded in the future.

Only emoji-es which diplay well on all platforms I usually use (neovim, lazygit, web browser, other IDEs, etc) are chosen.
